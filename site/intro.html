                just like any other languages like English, French, etc. From healthcare to animation games, programming plays a major role 
                in almost all the industries. It acts as a bridge between humans and machines.<br>

                <span>&nbsp;The history of programming dates long back &nbsp;to 1883 when Ada Lovelace and Charles &nbsp;Babbage worked together on the Analytical &nbsp;engine 
                    which is known to be the first &nbsp;mechanical computer. <br><br>Charles Babbage is known as the father of computer. Ada Lovelace is called as the first computer programmer.</span><br><br>
                    From there in 1880s to present, the programming community had witnessed several new ways of communicating with the computer for solving the problems. These several new ways are called as 
                    the programming languages. FORTRAN (1957) is a programming language that is developed for scientific and statistical projects. FORTRAN is one of the oldest programming languages that is still in use. FORTRAN is still used for weather forecasts, etc.
                    The other notable programming languages from the past that is still in use is Lisp (List processing) and COBOL.
